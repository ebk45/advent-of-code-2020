# Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. (For me, that's Javascript)

I'm planning on completing each problem in a quick and dirty way, then using these solutions as an opportunity to scrub up on my refactoring and optimization skills at a later date.
